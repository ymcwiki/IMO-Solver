**1. Summary**

* **a. Verdict:** Complete solution.  
* **b. Overview:** By concatenating the first two digits to form \(12\) and then applying the operations \( -3-4-5-6+7\), we obtain an expression that evaluates to \(1\). The expression uses the digits \(1,2,3,4,5,6,7\) in order, employs only the binary operations \(+\) and \(-\), and requires no parentheses.

---

**2. Reasoning**

**a. Understanding the Problem**  
We must form an arithmetic expression from the sequence of digits  
\[
1\,2\,3\,4\,5\,6\,7
\]
by either concatenating adjacent digits or inserting the binary operators \(+\) or \(-\) between them. The expression must evaluate exactly to \(1\). No operators or parentheses are allowed.

**b. Approach**  
A natural strategy is to try concatenating the first few digits to create a larger number that can be balanced by subsequent additions and subtractions. Since the target value is small (\(1\)), we look for a combination where the large number is almost cancelled by the remaining terms.

**c. Derivation**  
Consider concatenating the first two digits to obtain \(12\).  
We then need to reduce \(12\) down to \(1\) using the remaining digits \(3,4,5,6,7\).  
A simple way is to subtract \(3,4,5,6\) and finally add \(7\):

\[
12-3-4-5-6+7.
\]

We verify the calculation step by step:

\[
\begin{aligned}
12-3 &= 9,\\
9-4 &= 5,\\
5-5 &= 0,\\
0-6 &= -6,\\
-6+7 &= 1.
\end{aligned}
\]

Thus the expression evaluates to \(1\).  
All digits appear in the original order, only the allowed operators are used, and no parentheses are necessary because the operations are left‑to‑right associative.

---

**3. Detailed Solution**

We claim that the expression

\[
\boxed{12-3-4-5-6+7}
\]

satisfies the requirements.

* **Use of digits:** The digits \(1,2,3,4,5,6,7\) appear in the order \(1\,2\,3\,4\,5\,6\,7\).  
  The first two digits are concatenated to form the two‑digit number \(12\); the remaining digits are used individually.

* **Allowed operations:** Only the binary operators \(+\) and \(-\) are inserted between the numbers. No other operators or parentheses are present.

* **Evaluation:** Compute the value step by step:

\[
\begin{aligned}
12-3 &= 9,\\
9-4 &= 5,\\
5-5 &= 0,\\
0-6 &= -6,\\
-6+7 &= 1.
\end{aligned}
\]

Hence the expression equals \(1\).

Since all conditions are met, this expression provides a valid solution to the problem.
